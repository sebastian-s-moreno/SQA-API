# Get started
In this session you will copy the Forte.Academy.Developer.Api code.
Throughout the academy we will extend this code with more functionality and we will write unit, integration and GUI tests.

## Create a directory structure
- Create a new directory for the code you will write in this academy
- Inside the new directory, create a directory called ```Forte.Weather.Api```

## Copy web api
- Go to the save-points directory and copy all code under ```00-get-started``` into the newly created ```Forte.Weather.Api``` directory

## Test the solution
- Open Visual studio 2022
- Open the Forte.Weather solution and verify that you can run it

Next up - [Unit testing](01-unit-testing.md)
